# React and Web3 Demo app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is aimed to be a simple demo application powered by Ethereum blockchain made for [demo and video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUCprf8_vm4Dw-k2YEQL7kmXDsvPfbej) about React, Web3 and Solidity on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91Dik_GqQhj-4ga6YS2n6A).

The purpose of the video is to show you how to use Web3 from your React Application.  We will see how to connect to an Ethereum Dapp via MetaMask using Web3 & React.
